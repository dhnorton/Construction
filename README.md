# Cuis-Smalltalk-contractor
A simulation of the Construction board game, a Euro-style game for 2 to 6 players, which is similar to Monopoly. Players start with earth-moving equipment: two backhoes and one bulldozer. Each player also has a $100,000 line of credit. Moving tokens around the board, players try to succeed at jobs and be the first to acquire $1,500,000 in net assets (default).

As the game progresses the outcome is often increasingly unpredictable, ending in come-from-behind victories possible.
